    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p> Laravel's Eloquent Accessor allow you to manipulate a model attribute before returning it. 
        This can be extremely useful for defining global date formats, for example. However, the date format used for display might not match the date format used for form elements. 
        You can solve this by creating two separate accessors: a standard accessor, and/or a form accessor.</p>
